# CSMP & GPSS Simulation Projects 🎯

This repository contains **two separate simulation projects** developed to demonstrate different modeling approaches:

1. **🔄 Continuous System Simulation (CSMP)**  
   A continuous dynamics model built using **CSMP** (Continuous System Modeling Program), focusing on the nonlinear dynamics of a love relationship. This project illustrates continuous-time system behavior through differential equations and simulation.

2. **🎬 Discrete Event Simulation (GPSS)**  
   A discrete event simulation developed in **GPSS** (General Purpose Simulation System), modeling the sale of cinema tickets. This project captures event-driven system behavior such as queues, transactions, and process flows.
